* Booked seats should not appear anymore on the available seats for booking.
* Users need to log in to book.
* User Registration requires full name, email, mobile number and password.
* User Dashboard should see cinemas, movies and seats that they booked.

## Admin

* Movies are assigned to a cinema.
* Admin can see the list of cinemas and the users who booked.
* Admin dashboard landing page should display how many cinemas are registered and how many bookings they got.
